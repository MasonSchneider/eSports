# RHeSports Website

This site is used by the RHeSports club at Rose-Hulman in order to relay information for events as well as hold registrations before events.

## Why have a website?

With this site we've been able to share information about the club as well as host a Riot endorsed event due to the fact that our information is openly available and rules for tournaments are stated publicly as well as the results.
